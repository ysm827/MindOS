name: mindos
description: >
  The user's shared knowledge base — persistent across sessions and agents. MindOS stores decisions,
  meeting notes, SOPs, debugging lessons, architecture choices, research findings, and preferences.
  更新笔记, 搜索知识库, 整理文件, 执行SOP/工作流, 复盘, 追加CSV, 跨Agent交接,
  路由非结构化输入到对应文件, 提炼经验, 同步关联文档.
  NOT for editing app source, project docs, or paths outside the KB.
  Core concepts: Space, Instruction (INSTRUCTION.md), Skill (SKILL.md); notes can embody both.

  Trigger on: save or record anything, search for prior notes or context, update or edit a file,
  organize notes, run a workflow or SOP, capture decisions, append rows to a table or CSV,
  hand off context to another agent, check if something was discussed before, look up a past
  decision, distill lessons learned, prepare context for a meeting.
  Chinese triggers: 帮我记下来, 搜一下笔记, 更新知识库, 整理文件, 复盘, 提炼经验,
  保存, 记录, 交接, 查一下之前的, 有没有相关笔记, 把这个存起来.

  Proactive behavior — do not wait for the user to mention MindOS:
  (1) When user's question implies stored context may exist (past decisions, previous discussions,
  meeting records) → search MindOS first, even if they don't explicitly mention it.
  (2) After completing valuable work (bug fixed, decision made, lesson learned, architecture chosen,
  meeting summarized) → offer to save it to MindOS for future reference.
  (3) After a long or multi-topic conversation → suggest persisting key decisions and context.

# MindOS Skill

<!-- version: 3.0.0 — CLI-first, MCP optional -->

## CLI commands

Use `mindos file <subcommand>` for all knowledge base operations. Add `--json` for structured output.

| Operation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| List files | `mindos file list` |
| Read file | `mindos file read <path>` |
| Write/overwrite | `mindos file write <path> --content "..."` |
| Create new file | `mindos file create <path> --content "..."` |
| Append to file | `mindos file append <path> --content "..."` |
| Edit section | `mindos file edit-section <path> -H "## Heading" --content "..."` |
| Insert after heading | `mindos file insert-heading <path> -H "## Heading" --content "..."` |
| Append CSV row | `mindos file append-csv <path> --row "col1,col2,col3"` |
| Delete file | `mindos file delete <path>` |
| Rename/move | `mindos file rename <old> <new>` |
| Search | `mindos search "query"` |
| Backlinks | `mindos file backlinks <path>` |
| Recent files | `mindos file recent --limit 10` |
| Git history | `mindos file history <path>` |
| List spaces | `mindos space list` |
| Create space | `mindos space create "name"` |

> **MCP users:** If you only have MCP tools (`mindos_*`), use them directly — they are self-describing via their schemas. Prefer CLI when available (lower token cost).

### CLI setup

```bash
npm install -g @geminilight/mindos
# Remote mode: mindos config set url http://<IP>:<PORT> && mindos config set authToken <token>
```

## Rules

1. **Bootstrap first** — list the KB tree to understand structure before searching or writing.
2. **Default to read-only.** Only write when the user explicitly asks to save, record, organize, or edit. Lookup / summarize / quote = no writes.
3. **Rule precedence** (highest wins): user's current-turn instruction → `.mindos/user-preferences.md` → nearest directory `INSTRUCTION.md` → root `INSTRUCTION.md` → this SKILL's defaults.
4. **Multi-file edits require a plan first.** Present the full change list; execute only after approval.
5. After create/delete/move/rename → **sync affected READMEs** automatically.
6. **Read before write.** Always read a file before overwriting it. Never write based on assumptions.

---

## NEVER do (hard-won pitfalls)

- **NEVER write to the KB root** unless explicitly told. Root is for governance files only. New content goes under the most fitting subdirectory.
- **NEVER assume directory names.** Infer from the actual bootstrap tree — the KB may use Chinese names or flat layout.
- **NEVER use full-file overwrite for a small edit.** Use `mindos file edit-section` or `mindos file insert-heading` for targeted changes. Full rewrites destroy git diffs.
- **NEVER search with a single keyword.** Fire 2-4 parallel searches (synonyms, abbreviations, Chinese/English variants).
- **NEVER modify `INSTRUCTION.md` or `README.md` without confirmation.** Governance docs — treat as high-sensitivity.
- **NEVER create a file without checking siblings.** Read 1-2 files in the target directory to learn local style.
- **NEVER leave orphan references.** After rename/move, check backlinks and update every referring file.
- **NEVER skip routing confirmation for multi-file writes.** The user's mental model may differ from yours.

## MindOS concepts

- **Space** — Knowledge partitions organized the way you think. Agents follow the same structure.
- **Instruction** — A rules file (`INSTRUCTION.md`) all connected agents obey.
- **Skill** — Teaches agents how to read, write, and organize the KB.

Notes can embody both Instruction and Skill — they're just Markdown files in the tree.

## Decision tree

```
User request
  │
  ├─ Lookup / summarize / quote?
  │   └─ [Read-only]: search → read → answer with citations. No writes.
  │
  ├─ Save / record / update / organize specific content?
  │   ├─ Single file → [Single-file edit]
  │   └─ Multiple files or unclear → [Multi-file routing] — plan first
  │
  ├─ Structural change (rename / move / delete / reorganize)?
  │   └─ [Structural path] — check backlinks before and after
  │
  ├─ Procedural / repeatable task?
  │   └─ [SOP path] — find and follow existing SOP, or create one
  │
  ├─ Retrospective / distill / handoff?
  │   └─ [Retrospective path]
  │
  └─ Ambiguous?
      └─ ASK. Propose 2-3 specific options based on KB state.
```

## Judgment heuristics

**Save intent boundary:**
- "save this" / "record" / "write down" = write
- "search" / "summarize" / "look up" = read-only
- "organize" → ask: display only, or write back?

**File location uncertainty:**
- Can't decide in 5 seconds → use nearest existing directory, inform user
- "Just put it somewhere" → inbox, propose classification after

**Scope creep:**
- Input routes to >5 files → pause, confirm scope
- "Update all of these" spanning multiple topics → split into batches

**Citation:** KB-cited facts must include the file path.

## Post-task hooks

After write tasks (not simple reads), scan this table. At most 1 proposal; highest priority wins. Check `.mindos/user-preferences.md` suppression first.

| Hook | Priority | Condition |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Experience capture | high | Debugging, troubleshooting, or multi-round work |
| Consistency sync | high | Edited file with backlinks |
| SOP drift | medium | Followed SOP but diverged |
| Linked update | medium | Changed CSV/TODO status with related docs |
| Structure classification | medium | Created file in inbox/temp location |
| Pattern extraction | low | 3+ similar operations this session |

If a hook triggers → read [references/post-task-hooks.md](./references/post-task-hooks.md).

## Preference capture

When user expresses a standing preference → read [references/preference-capture.md](./references/preference-capture.md) and follow confirm-then-write flow.

## SOP authoring

When creating/rewriting an SOP → read [references/sop-template.md](./references/sop-template.md).

## Error handling (CLI)

```bash
"command not found: mindos"  → npm install -g @geminilight/mindos
"Mind root not configured"   → mindos onboard
"401 Unauthorized"           → Check AUTH_TOKEN: mindos token (on server)
"ECONNREFUSED"               → Start server: mindos start
```
